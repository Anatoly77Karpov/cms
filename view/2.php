      The&nbsp;<a href="https://pytorch.org/foundation">PyTorch Foundation</a>, a neutral hub facilitating collaboration within the deep learning community, has announced that Lightning AI has become a premier member.
</p>
<p>
      Lightning AI is the driving force behind&nbsp;<a href="https://lightning.ai/">PyTorch Lightning</a>, an open-source framework and platform empowering companies to construct and deploy cutting-edge AI products employing the latest generative AI models.
</p>
<p>
      Luca Antiga, CTO of Lightning AI, expressed the importance of this collaboration:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <p>
           “By joining the PyTorch Foundation, we are strengthening our commitment to boost the adoption of PyTorch across industries. We look forward to partnering with the Foundation to push the vision of PyTorch forward.”
     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
      PyTorch Lightning is a prominent project within the PyTorch ecosystem, enabling developers to create, train, fine-tune, and deploy AI models at scale. Its functionality has been instrumental in propelling the rapid adoption of PyTorch within both the research community and the corporate sector.
</p>
<p>
      Ibrahim Haddad, Executive Director of the PyTorch Foundation, acknowledged Lightning AI’s significant contributions, saying:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <p>
           “Lightning AI has been a great steward of the AI community, and notably a key contributor to PyTorch over the years. Their goal of making AI research scalable directly aligns with our mission at the foundation.”
     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
      As part of this collaboration, Lightning AI gains representation in the PyTorch Foundation Governing Board, a body responsible for setting policies, mission and vision statements, and determining the overarching scope of foundation initiatives.
</p>
<p>
      Welcoming Antiga to their board, the foundation acknowledged his expertise and previous contributions to the field.
</p>
<p>
      Antiga joined Lightning AI in April 2021 and has a rich background in AI research, having co-founded applied AI company&nbsp;<a href="https://orobix.com/en/">Orobix</a>&nbsp;and data-defined infrastructure provider&nbsp;<a href="https://tensorwerk.com/">Tensorwerk</a>. His early core contributions to PyTorch and co-authoring of the book ‘Deep Learning with PyTorch’ highlight his expertise in the field.
