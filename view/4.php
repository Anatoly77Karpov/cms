        During its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sap.com/uk/events/teched.html">TechEd</a>&nbsp;event,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sap.com/index.html">SAP</a>&nbsp;made a series of announcements aimed at empowering developers with generative AI capabilities.
</p>
<p>
        Juergen Mueller, CTO and member of the Executive Board of SAP, stressed the importance of adapting to the evolving technology and business environment.
</p>
<p>
        “Today’s dynamic landscape demands every developer to be an AI developer,” Mueller affirmed. “The innovations we’re launching at SAP TechEd provide developers with the resources they need to transform the way businesses operate.”

        SAP’s latest offering,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.sap.com/2022/11/sap-teched-sap-build-business-expertise-coursera-partnership/">SAP Build</a>, facilitates effective collaboration between professional and citizen developers. These solutions, optimised for Java and JavaScript development, integrate AI-powered productivity tools. They also leverage SAP’s new generative AI co-pilot,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sap.com/uk/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html">Joule</a>, enhancing productivity by embedding code generation capabilities for data models, application logic, and test script creation.
</p>
<p>
        Recognising the foundational role of good data in AI, SAP HANA Cloud has introduced innovative vector database features to its multimodel offerings, at no extra cost. These features allow the management of unstructured data, like text, images, or audio, providing long-term memory and context to AI models.
</p>
<p>
        For instance, users can now search for suppliers based on language in contracts, enabling in-depth analyses of payment history and individual orders. These enhancements ensure SAP developers deliver unparalleled data insights within a secure, private framework.
</p>
<p>
        Furthermore, SAP unveiled the AI Foundation on SAP&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sap.com/uk/products/technology-platform.html">Business Technology Platform</a>&nbsp;(BTP), a comprehensive platform empowering developers to create AI- and generative AI-powered extensions and applications. This all-encompassing solution includes ready-to-use AI services, access to large language models, vector database capabilities, and AI runtime and lifecycle management.
</p>
<p>
        In response to the escalating demand for skilled developers globally, SAP has expanded its learning opportunities. The company has committed to upskilling two million professionals by 2025 and has launched role-based certification and free learning resources for back-end developers. These resources, covering ABAP development tools on SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA, are designed to facilitate agile and cloud-compliant business transformation.
</p>
<p>
        SAP has also joined the&nbsp;<a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/corporate-affiliate-program">Stanford HAI Corporate Affiliate Program</a>. This collaboration will see SAP’s researchers and engineers working alongside the Stanford academic community, exploring the intersection of generative AI and business.
</p>
<p>
        As individuals and enterprises navigate the evolving landscape, SAP’s advancements in generative AI will help to reshape the way developers and businesses operate.
