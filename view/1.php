<p>
 <a href="https://www.azul.com/">Azul</a>&nbsp;has unveiled its first annual State of Java Survey &amp; Report, which offers a deep exploration of the Java landscape.
</p>
<p>
     The study – based on responses from over 2,000 Java users worldwide – aims to provide unparalleled insights into Java’s current standing, particularly its influence on enterprises of various sizes.
</p>
<h4>Java’s ubiquity and vital role</h4>
<p>
     The report underscores Java’s pervasive presence, with a staggering 98 percent of businesses surveyed utilising Java in their software applications or infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
     For 57 percent of these organisations, Java serves as the backbone of most of their applications.
</p>
<p>
     When incorporating Java-based frameworks, libraries, and other languages utilising the Java Virtual Machine, it becomes apparent that Java continues to play a fundamental role in today’s enterprises.
</p>
<h4>Oracle’s licensing changes spark concerns</h4>
<p>
     However, Oracle’s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/java-se-subscription/">Java SE Universal</a>&nbsp;subscription pricing changes have raised substantial concerns. A significant 82 percent of respondents utilising Oracle Java expressed apprehension about the new pricing structure.
</p>
<p>
     This change, the fourth major licensing/pricing alteration in four years, shifted the cost calculation from the number of processors used to the total count of employees and contractors within an organisation.
</p>
<p>
     As a result, 72 percent of respondents are contemplating open-source alternatives such as&nbsp;<a href="https://openjdk.org/">OpenJDK</a>.
</p>
<p>
     Emiliano Fisanotti, Vendor Management Specialist at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/">The University of Sydney</a>, said: “As with most universities, we are always looking for efficiency from our IT vendor relationships, not just by lowering costs, but also by eliminating uncertainty and distractions.
</p>
<p>
     “Supporting so many departments and managing a wide range of vendor relationships means I can’t afford to worry about unexpected headaches such as price increases and audits.”
</p>
<h4>Java in the cloud</h4>
<p>
     The survey delved into Java’s integration into cloud environments, with 90 percent of respondents utilising Java in public, private, or hybrid cloud setups.
</p>
<p>
     Despite the advantages of cloud adoption, cost and security concerns persist. Nearly 70 percent of organisations admitted to paying for unused cloud capacity due to overprovisioning.
</p>
<p>
     Jevin Jensen, Research VP for Intelligent CloudOps at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idc.com/">IDC</a>, commented: “Enterprises often don’t use all the cloud computing they pay for due to the over-provisioning of virtual servers required to accommodate spikes in demand from ultra high-performing applications and those where end-user experience is paramount. But this creates challenges for IT teams facing a difficult budget environment that requires more efficient use of resources.
</p>
<p>
     “Running Java applications and infrastructure with a faster and more efficient JVM can provide superior performance, consistency, and the capacity to address these challenges, gaining tangible business results today.”
</p>
<h4>Security challenges</h4>
<p>
     Approximately 80 percent of respondents reported being impacted by the Log4Shell vulnerability, underlining the ongoing threat posed by security vulnerabilities in Java applications.
</p>
<p>
     Third-party and open-source applications emerged as the primary sources of concern, with 57 percent of respondents highlighting open-source libraries and applications as major concerns.
</p>
<p>
     Azul’s report provides a comprehensive view of Java’s enduring significance in the technology landscape. While challenges such as licensing changes and security vulnerabilities persist, businesses are actively exploring alternative solutions that could reshape the Java ecosystem.
